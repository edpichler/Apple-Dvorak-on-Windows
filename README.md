# Dvorak International Layout for Apple Bluetooth Keyboards on Windows

You can use your Apple Bluetooth Keyboard with Dvorak layout, under Windows 7+.

## How to use
1. Install the Dvorak layout. Compiled packages are located in the **dist** folder. 
2. Open your Windows Keyboard Preferences, and choose the new layout you installed.
3. Execute the .exe located in the Auxiliar Software folder. It's necessary to have the `fn` key working.

Now you can use the Apple Dvorak Keyboard.

## How to compile by yourself
Use the "Windows Keyboard Layout Editor" ( found it in installer folder) and open the **.klc** file and make the changes you want. If you did something useful, do not exitate to create a pull request for me.

## Tips
1. To active and deactive the `Insert` key, just hold `fn` and press `Enter`.
2. For a better use, you need to execute the auxiliar software (Auxiliar Software folder) each time Windows starts.
3. If your computer wake up without the `fn` key working, you can refresh the connection (an Auxiliar Software feature) and it will work again, like in the image:

## Known issues
1. In some cases, on the Login prompt of Windows change the layout to default. After you log in, Dvorak layout is actived automatically.
